# Authentication & Onboarding PRD

## Status

**Stages 1–4 complete.** Stage 5 (Database/RLS) next.

### Known issues / open tasks

- [ ] **Fix onboarding completion loop** — After Get Started/Skip, user may loop between `/onboarding` and `/workspace`. Likely cause: JWT not yet refreshed when proxy runs on redirect, so `sessionClaims.metadata.onboardingComplete` is still stale. Consider: add short delay before redirect, use `router.refresh()`, or ensure `getToken({ skipCache: true })` completes and cookie propagates before `window.location.href`. Track in Linear if using (e.g. A-XX).

## Objective

Implement secure, user-friendly authentication with Clerk and Supabase, focusing on email/password login with a 3-screen onboarding experience for new users. Main app route: `/workspace`.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- User signup with Clerk (email/password only)
- User login with Clerk (email/password only)
- Clerk + Supabase integration (native integration enabled in Clerk dashboard)
- Protected routes and middleware
- 3-screen skippable onboarding (custom pages, not Clerk's built-in onboarding UI)
- Custom redirects after auth actions
- Row-level security (RLS) policies for user data isolation
- Responsive auth UI matching our design system

**Out of Scope (Future Considerations):**
- Social login (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Password reset flow (uses Clerk defaults initially)
- Email verification (uses Clerk defaults)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- User profile editing pages
- Advanced onboarding with custom fields
- Webhooks for data synchronization

## User Stories

1. As a new user, I want to sign up with email/password so I can start using the app
2. As a returning user, I want to log in quickly and go straight to my content
3. As a new user, I want to see a brief onboarding that explains the app's value
4. As any user, I want my data to be secure and isolated from other users
5. As a mobile user, I want auth flows to work smoothly on my device

## Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Clerk + Supabase Setup ✅

**User actions (manual steps):**
- [x] Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) → Navigate to Integrations → Select Supabase
- [x] Follow Clerk's setup wizard to connect your Supabase project
- [x] Keep the Clerk dashboard tab open — you'll need API keys

**Configure Session Token (Critical for Onboarding):**
- [x] Before building anything, configure the session token in Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Navigate to: **Sessions** → **Customize session token**
3. Add this custom claim in the JSON editor:
```json
{
  "role": "authenticated",
  "metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"
}
```
4. Click **Save**

**Why:** Middleware checks the JWT session token. Without this, `publicMetadata` won't be in the JWT, and the onboarding status check will fail (infinite redirect loops).

**AI agent actions:**
- [x] Install `@clerk/nextjs` package
- [x] Ensure `@supabase/supabase-js` is installed (already present)
- [x] Wrap the app with ClerkProvider in the root layout

**Environment variables:**
From Clerk Dashboard (Settings → API Keys):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Publishable key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` — Secret key

Redirect URLs:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/workspace`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/onboarding`

**Note:** Use `_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` naming (not deprecated `_AFTER_`).

- [x] Test that Clerk is connected (visit the app and see auth state)

### Stage 2: Auth Pages and User Button ✅

**Create Authentication Pages:**
- [x] Create `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`
- [ ] Add Clerk `<SignUp />` with `routing="path"` and `path="/sign-up"`
- [ ] Style signup page to match design system (Clerk appearance prop or CSS)
- [x] Create `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` (currently at src/app, not (auth) group)
- [ ] Add Clerk `<SignIn />` with `routing="path"` and `path="/sign-in"`
- [ ] Style login page to match design system
- [ ] Configure custom redirects in both components
- [ ] Test signup flow: create account → redirects to onboarding
- [ ] Test login flow: sign in → redirects to workspace

**Add User Button to Header:**
- [x] Locate or create header component (e.g. in layout or a shared header)
- [x] Import UserButton, SignedIn, SignedOut from `@clerk/nextjs`
- [x] Add UserButton inside `<SignedIn>` in top-right of header
- [x] Add SignInButton inside `<SignedOut>` for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Style per design system
- [ ] Test: Sign in → UserButton appears; click → Manage account / Sign out

### Stage 3: Protected Routes and Middleware

**Protected route:** `/workspace` (and nested paths like `/workspace/*`)

**AI agent actions:**
- [x] Create `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 uses proxy.ts; middleware.ts deprecated)
- [x] Import `clerkMiddleware`, `createRouteMatcher` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- [x] Define public routes: `createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)'])`; protects all others via `auth.protect()`
- [ ] TODO: Refine to protect `/workspace(.*)` only; add `/sign-up`, `/`, `/onboarding` to public matcher

- [x] Add config matcher for Next.js internals, static files, API routes
- [x] Test: Visit /workspace signed out → redirect to /sign-in?redirect_url=...
- [x] Test: Sign in → visit /workspace → loads; redirect-back works

**Note:** Next.js 16 uses `src/proxy.ts` (middleware.ts deprecated). Current implementation uses `auth.protect()`.

### Stage 4: 3-Screen Onboarding ✅

**Metadata:** Store `onboardingComplete` in `publicMetadata` (NOT `unsafeMetadata` — it won't be in JWT).

**AI agent actions:**

**1. Create Onboarding Layout & Page:**
- [x] Create `app/onboarding/layout.tsx` (server component)
- [x] Use `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` to get userId and sessionClaims
- [x] If not authenticated → redirect to /sign-in
- [x] If `sessionClaims?.metadata?.onboardingComplete === true` → redirect to /workspace
- [x] Create `app/onboarding/page.tsx` (client component)

**2. Build 3-Screen Component:**
- **Screen 1:** "Welcome to [App Name]"; subheading about trackable actions; progress 1 of 3; Next, Skip
- **Screen 2:** "Stay in control with the approval layer"; benefits; progress 2 of 3; Next, Back, Skip
- **Screen 3:** "Ready to get started?"; progress 3 of 3; Get Started, Back, Skip

**3. Server Action for Metadata:**
- [x] Create `app/onboarding/actions.ts` with `"use server"`
- [x] `completeOnboarding()`: uses `updateUserMetadata()` with awaited `clerkClient()`
- [ ] Returns `{ success: true }` or `{ error: "message" }`; do NOT call redirect() in server action

**4. Client Completion Logic (JWT Refresh Pattern):**
```ts
const { getToken } = useAuth();
const handleComplete = async () => {
  setIsCompleting(true);
  const result = await completeOnboarding();
  if (result?.error) { toast.error(result.error); setIsCompleting(false); return; }
  await getToken({ skipCache: true });  // CRITICAL: refresh JWT
  window.location.href = "/workspace";   // Hard redirect, NOT router.push()
};
```

**5. Update Middleware for Onboarding:**
- [x] If user authenticated but `!onboardingComplete` and accessing protected route → redirect to /onboarding
- [x] Exception: allow access to /onboarding page
- [x] Read from `sessionClaims?.metadata?.onboardingComplete`

**6. Style:** Match design system; mobile responsive; smooth transitions (Framer Motion optional)

**7. Test:** New user → onboarding → Get Started; Skip; Returning user skips; Back navigation

**Known issue:** Post-completion redirect can loop (see Known issues above).

### Stage 5: Database Setup and RLS

**Reference:** [Clerk + Supabase Integration](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/integrations/databases/supabase)

**Supabase setup (manual):**
- [ ] Clerk Dashboard → [Supabase integration](https://dashboard.clerk.com/setup/supabase) → Activate
- [ ] Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Sign In / Up → Add provider → Clerk
- [ ] Paste Clerk domain

**AI agent actions:**
- [ ] Create table with `user_id text not null default auth.jwt()->>'sub'`
- [ ] Enable RLS on table
- [ ] Create policies: SELECT and INSERT restricted to own user_id
- [ ] Create Supabase client helper that passes Clerk session token (see Clerk docs)
- [ ] Test: User A creates record → User B cannot see it; unauthenticated denied

**Note:** No webhooks needed for basic auth + data isolation. Webhooks only needed for syncing profile data.

### Stage 6: Testing and Polish

- [ ] Test new user: signup → onboarding → workspace
- [ ] Test returning user: login → workspace (skip onboarding)
- [ ] Test error states: invalid email, weak password, email exists, wrong password
- [ ] Test mobile responsive
- [ ] Verify redirect_url works after login
- [ ] Use Chrome DevTools MCP for visual verification if available

### Stage 7: Documentation and Commit

- [ ] Update this PRD with ✅ for completed stages
- [ ] Document environment variables in .env.example
- [ ] Commit: `feat(auth): implement clerk authentication with supabase integration`
- [ ] Update Linear sprint board

## Key Technical Notes

**Proxy:** In `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16). Use `createRouteMatcher` for public routes; `auth.protect()` for protected. Clear `.next` and restart after changes.

**Session Token:** Configure custom claim `{"metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"}`. Middleware reads `sessionClaims.metadata.onboardingComplete`.

**Onboarding:** Store in `publicMetadata`. After update, call `getToken({ skipCache: true })`, then `window.location.href = "/workspace"`.

**Supabase:** RLS uses `auth.jwt()->>'sub'` for user_id. Create Clerk Supabase client helper per docs.

**Routes:** Sign-in fallback = `/workspace`. Sign-up fallback = `/onboarding`. Protected = `/workspace(.*)`.
