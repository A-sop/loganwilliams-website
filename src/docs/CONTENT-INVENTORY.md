## Hero & Bio

**Headline:** Hey, I'm Logan

**Subhead:** I help expats in Germany make better financial decisions—with clarity, confidence, and ease.

**This is me now:**
> I'm originally from Australia, now living in Cologne. I didn't take the straight path. I left home at 15, worked in hospitality and entertainment for years, and got my German Abitur later in life. Eventually, I found my way into financial planning.
>
> While nobody has all the answers, I've developed a clear and effective approach to guide you toward what truly matters—based directly on your goals and priorities.
>
> If you're trying to get a handle on things like health insurance, retirement planning, or just want to make sense of the German system without feeling like a tourist at the Finanzamt... you're in the right place.
>
> Also on this site: A Book Club because I was craving better conversations. Thoughts on Life in Germany from someone who's lived it sideways. My older Model work (yes, really). And ways to work with me—especially if you like coffee and a clear plan.
>
> Book a chat to see if we're a fit—because finding the right match should feel straightforward.

## Pillar Descriptions

**Life in Germany:**
> Insights from the inside—but with a foreigner's filter. From registering your address to decoding German directness and mastering the art of opening a beer bottle with literally anything—this is where I share insights from over 16 years of life in Germany.

**Work With Me:**
> Financial planning for expats who appreciate clarity over complexity. I help you get clear on your priorities, understand what Germany offers (and expects), and build a plan you can actually stick to. No pressure. No fluff. Just a conversation that makes things feel a bit less overwhelming. Let's grab a coffee (in person or over Teams) and figure out your next step.

**Personal Finance:**
> For expats who want clarity, not just contracts. This is where I break down the big stuff—health insurance, pensions, smart saving strategies, and building a proper financial base. I'm not here to upsell you on weird products. I'm here to help you understand your options and make decisions you feel good about.

**Book Club:**
> Real talk, page by page. I started this because I needed better conversations. It's not just reviews—it's reflections, questions, and "wait, did anyone else highlight this line six times?" Whether it's non-fiction, memoirs, or classic gems from the Lindy book list, this is where the good stuff lives. Keep an eye out—I'm also developing regular meetups right here in Cologne.
