# Linear Task Management & Prefix System

**Purpose:** Structured task ownership, permission, and execution scope across multi-product, human-in-the-loop system.

**Context:** This system applies to all projects. When in loganwilliams-website, use `LDW-` for this project's tasks—but you can create Linear issues for any project (CM, LDW, LT, GFP) from this workspace.

---

## Prefix Structure

All Linear issues and tasks use structured prefixes:

```
[OWNER]-[DOMAIN]-[SURFACE] Task description
```

### OWNERS (Project Identifiers)

| Prefix | Owner | Project |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `CM` | Consulting & More | Reza's business / concierge system (my-app) |
| `LDW` | Logan Williams | Logan's personal branding website (loganwilliams.com) — this project |
| `LT` | Logan Tools | logans.tools — productised internal or external tools |
| `GFP` | German Financial Planning | Regulated financial planning business (high compliance sensitivity) |

**Note:** Owner prefixes identify **which project** the task belongs to, not permission level. You can create Linear issues for any project from this IDE—it's the central task-management hub when working across projects in parallel.

### DOMAINS (Permission & Scope)

| Prefix | Domain | Permission | Scope |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| `BIZ` | Business | **Human Required** | Big picture, strategy, content, compliance, outreach, positioning, marketing, one-way-door decisions |
| `OPS` | Operations | **Human-in-the-loop** | Day-to-day operational work, recurring tasks, running existing processes for real clients |
| `DEV` | Development | **Can Execute** | Code, systems, automation, infrastructure, technical implementation |

**Key Rule:**
- **`-BIZ-`** = Strategic / directional decisions → humans decide, AI assists.
- **`-OPS-`** = Operative daily work → humans act, AI prepares/checklists/automation.
- **`-DEV-`** = Technical implementation → AI can execute autonomously in code.

### SURFACES (Optional)

| Prefix | Surface | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `WEB` | Web | Public website, landing pages, marketing site |
| `APP` | Application | Dashboard, system, authenticated app interface |

**Note:** If SURFACE is omitted, task applies across all surfaces.

## Execution Rules

### 1. -BIZ- Tasks (Human Required)

**Rule:** Any task with `-BIZ-` requires **human judgment, decisions, or approval**.

**Examples:** `LDW-BIZ`: "Define personal brand messaging" → Draft options, human chooses. `CM-BIZ`: "Draft pricing strategy" → Draft options, human decides.

### 2. -OPS- Tasks (Operations)

**Rule:** Any task with `-OPS-` is **human-in-the-loop**—running the machine, real clients, repeatable work.

**Examples:** `LDW-OPS-WEB`: "Publish this pre-approved case study" → I prepare content and steps; you click publish.

### 3. -DEV- Tasks (Can Execute)

**Rule:** Tasks with `-DEV-` can be **executed autonomously** (write code, implement features, fix bugs).

**Examples:** `LDW-DEV`: "Build portfolio gallery component" → Execute directly. `LDW-DEV-WEB`: "Add insights page with MDX" → Execute directly.

### 4. GFP Tasks (Regulatory Sensitivity)

**Rule:** GFP tasks must be handled **conservatively** due to regulatory compliance.

### 5. LDW Tasks (This Project)

**Rule:** LDW tasks are for Logan's personal branding website (loganwilliams.com). `LDW-BIZ` = human decisions (brand, messaging). `LDW-DEV` = can execute (technical implementation). When in this workspace, default LDW for coding tasks unless you specify another project.

## Integration with Linear

**When creating Linear issues:**
1. Always include prefix in title: `[OWNER]-[DOMAIN]-[SURFACE] Description`
2. Use `-BIZ-` for business/strategy/content tasks (human required)
3. Use `-DEV-` for development/technical tasks (can execute)
4. Create issues for **any project** (CM, LDW, LT, GFP) when requested

**For this project (loganwilliams-website):**
- Use `LDW-` prefix for tasks related to this site
- `LDW-DEV` = Development (can execute)
- `LDW-BIZ` = Business (human required)
- You can still create CM, GFP, LT issues from here when needed

---

## Automatic: human-todos → Linear

**When adding a new checklist item to `src/docs/human-todos.md`, automatically:**
1. Create a corresponding Linear issue using the prefix convention above
2. Use `LDW-DEV-WEB` for dev tasks on the website, `LDW-BIZ` for strategy/content
3. Include the Linear issue ID in the human-todos item (e.g. `- [ ] **A-100** Set up cookie consent…`)
4. Add the issue to the "Linear Issues Created" list at the top of human-todos.md if that section exists

**Example:** Adding "Set up cookie consent management" → create `LDW-DEV-WEB Set up cookie consent management` in Linear, then reference `A-100` (or the returned ID) in human-todos.
