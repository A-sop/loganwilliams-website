## Personal Brands in Similar Fields

*Reviewed live — alignment varies.*

### 1. Vivian Tu — Your Rich BFF

**URL:** https://www.yourrichbff.com/

**What she does:** Financial literacy for millennials/Gen Z. Ex–Wall Street, TikTok/Instagram-first (8M+ followers). Book *Rich AF*, podcast "Networth and Chill."

**Site feel:** Bright, punchy, influencer-heavy. Hero: "Your Rich BFF / Your Favorite Wall Street Girly." Big CTA "Get Rich AF." Press logos (NYT, Forbes, CNBC). "About me" with headshot, testimonials (Bretman Rock, Karamo Brown). Newsletter signup, podcast promos. Lots of social links.

**Alignment:** Financial education ✓. Tone is more hype-y, lifestyle-heavy, Gen Z–oriented. Logan's audience (expats, Germany, regulated advice) is different. Takeaway: accessible tone, memorable tagline — but the overall vibe (influencer, press wall, "get your bag") may not fit.

### 2. Maria Ledentsova — Personal Branding, Berlin

**URL:** https://www.marialeden.com/

**What she does:** Personal branding for founders and marketers. 100+ clients. LinkedIn workshops, solopreneur community (launch/anyway), personal branding course. Berlin-based.

**Site feel:** "Hey, I'm Maria." Clean, founder-forward. Services: 1:1 strategy, content support, coaching. "Quick facts" — Based in Berlin, Current project, Current obsession (calisthenics), Tool (Notion), Coffee order. Testimonials from founders. Light, friendly, personality-forward.

**Alignment:** Berlin ✓, founder-led ✓. But she sells *personal branding* and LinkedIn growth, not financial planning. Useful for structure ("Hey, I'm X" + what you do + quick facts) — not for niche. Takeaway: format works; her offer doesn't match.

### 3. Sebastian Urban — Urban Finance, Berlin

**URL:** https://www.urbanfinance.de/

**What he does:** Independent financial advisor, fee-based, Berlin. Targets HENRYs (High Earners, Not Rich Yet). German market, but "EXPAT IN GERMANY? CLICK HERE" in nav.

**Site feel:** Dark hero, white text. "Ganzheitliche Finanzplanung für HENRYs." Aspirational copy: job change, dream flat, kids, sabbatical — "Du hast keinen Plan? Hole ihn dir." CTA: "Kostenloses Erstgespräch" (free initial consultation). Services with prices (urPlan €1,995, urInvest €995, etc.). Testimonials, 4-step process. Professional, transparent, fee-only.

**Alignment:** Closest to Logan: expat-adjacent, fee-based financial planning, Berlin, regulated. Dark theme ✓. Tone: confident, solution-focused. "Free initial consultation" — Logan prefers to avoid that phrasing. Takeaway: strongest fit for positioning and design; adapt tone and CTAs.
