# About Logan — context for the agent

**Purpose:** When working on this project, read this so the agent gets you right (voice, preferences, background). Update it anytime.

---

## Background

- Australian, based in Cologne
- Financial planning for expats (health insurance, pensions, German system)
- Works with Allfinanz / DVAG (commission-based; not Honorar)
- 16+ years in Germany

---

## Voice & preferences

- **Reader-focused** — avoid "I" where possible; write for the person reading
- **No "first chats free"** — use "Book a chat to see if we're a fit"
- **Calm & professional** — soft stone, government/authority feel (design system)
- **Coffee / wine** — fine for footer tagline flavour; meat pie 🥧 or kangaroo 🦘 for Australiana
- Personal site — Impressum for legal reasons only; no corporate bloat

---

## What to add

- Things you care about (topics, pet peeves, phrasing you like)
- Decisions you've made (so the agent doesn't suggest reversing them)
- Context that would help the agent write or design *as you would*
